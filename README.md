# About me

I'm an engineer who loves learning and seeking intriguing things ranging from web technologies to the English grammars and sentences from the 1600s (Early Modern English) to the present-day English.

## Why enjoying English in such a way?

Throughout my life, I try to tackle and understand anything hard to solve, finding a beautiful world behind it.

I have been studying English for as long as 3 years, and have faced, and become able to read, **so great an amount of sentences and ideas that I cannot recall how many they are.** They always demand my focused attention, driving me depressed sometimes.

But keeping tackling them, let them be never so hard or complex, I found myself "living," as a creature that can cut a single complex idea into smaller ones, making a thing simple, but producing more results, and becoming able to not only solve much harder problem, but **live without failing to notice beauty of beautiful ideas (logic, theory, etc)**.

I'd love to quote my favorite excerpts from a wonderful work translation to conclude my explanations in a well-formed way:

> THE memorable vividness of language, the sustained interconnections of argument, the insistent logic, the vast scale of the structure, and the learning and mental power required to sustain it all: these never fail in Leviathan.
>
> Hobbes, Thomas. Leviathan (Oxford World's Classics) (p. xi). OUP Oxford.

(My favorite textbooks dealing with English linguistically, and novels whose stories bring me to their worlds as soon as I start reading.)
